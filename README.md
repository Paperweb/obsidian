# Obsidian Moons

_Originally posted on the [Obsidian.md Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/insert-moon-phase-in-daily-note-with-templater) to share my implementation of the phases; quickly after i created another script for moon signs (coming soon). After some time (exactly one year later, thanks to my "last year on this date" daily feature, and a request, i added full moon names, optimized the script while at it, and created this repository._

## Moon Phase Templater Script

### Concept

With the help of a javascript function, the moon phase is derived from the fileâ€™s date and inserted in a daily note through its template and Templater.

### Requirements & Dependencies

- [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html), installed
- The javascript file moon_phase.js, in this repository
- Thatâ€™s all!

### Preliminary setup

Place the moon_phase.js script inside the folder of your choice. I chose Atlas/Ressources/scripts in my vault.
In the Templater settings, under User Scripts Functions, locate the scripts folder and Refresh ðŸ”„ the Detected User Scripts.

### Template implementation

This implementation is relative to the fileâ€™s title.
For my usage, i wanted to insert the moon phase inside my daily notes, which have a YYYY-MM-DD file title format. I already use Templater to generate various elements of the note based on the file title (it allows to create the file whenever i want and still have relative dates inside it).

- Open your daily noteâ€™s template â€• i wonâ€™t detail how to set it up if youâ€™re not using any yet, itâ€™s easy enough to find around here.
- On a new line, or wherever you want the moon phase displayed, insert : `<% tp.user.moon_phase(tp) %>`
- For the most basic (northern hemisphere, english) implementation, thatâ€™s enough!

### Customization

In order for a bit more control over the information displayed, I was about to write that you could play inside the javascript file; but i actually took the time and fun to expand it so that we can instead provide the function with optional parameters.

`<% tp.user.moon_phase(tp, language, display, separator, title_format, hemisphere) %>`

- `tp` : the templater object, mandatory to retrieve the date
- `language` : the textâ€™s language; currently, only `"en"` (default), `"fr"`, and `"es"` are supported
- `display` : what is being rendered
  - `"emoji text"` for emoji and text (default)
  - `"text emoji"` for text and emoji
  - `"emoji"` for emoji only
  - `"text"` for text only
- `separator` : the character between emoji and text; default : `" "` (space)
- `title_format` : your daily noteâ€™s title format; default : `"YYYY-MM-DD"`
- `hemisphere` : the hemisphere you are in; will influence which emoji is shown, as the moon is viewed upside down; default : `"N"`
- `moonNames` : specifies if the names of the full moons are displayed; default `true`
- `moonNamesEmoji` : specifies if the emojis of the named full moon are displayed; default `true`

If you donâ€™t provide any other parameter than the mandatory `tp`, it will default to :

`<% tp.user.moon_phase(tp, "en", "et", " ", "YYYY-MM-DD", "N", true, true) %>`

If you want to provide only some parameters, you have to enter them in order, and can skip the ones you do not need to replace by writing `undefined` or ommit them if they're at the end.

For example, Chileâ€™s moon phase, with emoji and text separated with a bar :

`<% tp.user.moon_phase(tp, "es", undefined, " | ", undefined, "S") %>`

will be interpreted as :

Â­Â­`<% tp.user.moon_phase(tp, "es", "et", " | ", "YYYY-MM-DD", "S", true, true) %>`

and rendered on August 14th, 2024 as :

`ðŸŒ– | Luna Gibosa Creciente`

### Contribute

Please mention any bug you find, or useful language translations that could be implemented.
For my use it works like it is, so i canâ€™t promise any further update. But i might, once in a while.
I am not a professional developper, so there might be innefficiencies in the code, but i believe itâ€™s good enough!

Hope you find it useful and informative!
